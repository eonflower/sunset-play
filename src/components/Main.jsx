			<h2>The Truth of Pine</h2>
			<h4>a short poem by Aloe</h4>
			<p>
				What if pining meant that I could finally be a tree? Instead of pining over love, I'd be a hemlock. 
				Don't mistake these tiny cones for a lack of power or jurisdiction in the world. 
				For not everything big and mighty is the best. 
			</p><p>
				Fragile squishy flesh to a thickly grooved shell. 
				From wispy beach curls to needle filled twigs. From long lost dreams of my childhood to present 
				day reality. Listen to the laughter of the wind while huddling in closely. There is shelter from 
				the tears of the clouds, but don't forget to remind them that you love them. You see, the sun will 
				hear the sweet whispers through the thicket of the fog, but the vapor of the clouds will dissipate 
				if you let it. 
			</p><p>
				Tomorrow I'll hang my branches to the side, but not in sorrow you see. For now that 
				I am a pine, I am relinquished of what it means to struggle as a human. I am sedentary and I like it. 
				The bugs will find safety beneath this bark-ish skin. The birds will find home in my branches. 
			</p><p>
				Pining. For I am living my truth in the world. 
			</p>
